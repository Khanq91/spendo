- Use a shared `MotionSpec` instead of hardcoded durations so future widgets can respect one reduce-motion policy.
- Keep Phase 0 primitives disconnected from business providers and PowerSync state; Phase 1 can wire them into screens with smaller diffs.
- Use built-in Flutter animation widgets first (`AnimatedScale`, `TweenAnimationBuilder`, `LinearProgressIndicator`) and do not add a motion package.
- Keep Liquid Glass as an explicit fancy-mode surface policy; Phase 0 does not expand glass into data-heavy lists or charts.

- Treat existing repo analyzer warnings/infos as out of scope for Phase 0 unless they are caused by the new motion primitives.
